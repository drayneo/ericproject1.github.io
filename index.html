      <h2>Mind Blank Haiku</h2>

      <p>Doing a project<br>
         Couldn't think of a haiku<br>
         Until I wrote this</p>

      <h2>My Personal Interests</h2>

      <p>First of all, I have loved music games since I was a child. I started playing Dance Dance Revolution when I was 11 years old,
         and still played regularly at a local arcade before COVID-19 hit, so I'm looking forward to getting regular exercise playing it
         again soon now that I'm vaccinated. My passion for Dance Dance Revolution stretched into other music games made by the same 
         Japanese developer, and I've ended up taking 4 trips to Japan since 2014 as a result.
      </p>

      <p>I also have a huge passion for eSports. I grew up playing PC games thanks to my dad because he thought the best way to bond with
         his 7-year-old child was to play Quake III and Unreal Tournament together. Starting around 2012 I started seeing online streams for
         competitive tournaments for games I loved playing, and I got more and more hooked. I started picking favorite teams and following
         players as they were removed from and joined new teams! To this day I definitely think I watch more video games than I play.
      </p>

      <p>Lastly, I have a huge passion for traveling. Before COVID I was lucky enough to travel to Japan like I mentioned before, but other
         countries I've visited include England, France, Switzerland, Italy, New Zealand, and Hong Kong. Hopefully I can start saving up
         money again, and traveling becomes more feasible as the world recovers from COVID!
